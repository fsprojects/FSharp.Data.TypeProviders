# Old F# Type Providers

The Old F# Type Providers SqlDataConnection, SqlEntityConnection, ODataService, WsdlService and EdmxFile.
Implemented using .NET Framework code generators. These may only be used within .NET Framework projects, and probably require the .NET Framework F# compiler, which is now only available as part of Visual Studio, and is not available in the .NET SDK.


For up-to-date type providers see https://fsharp.org/guides/data-access/ and search on Google.

For WSDL see https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharp.Data.WsdlProvider

For modern WebAPIs see [FSharp.Data](https://fsprojects.github.io/FSharp.Data/) and also [SwaggerProvider](https://fsprojects.github.io/SwaggerProvider/)
